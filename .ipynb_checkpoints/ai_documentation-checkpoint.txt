I used ChatGPT for HW3 to help debug a KeyError in my Python code and to explain how a sorting algorithm worked. For the KeyError, I pasted my code and ChatGPT suggested adding a key check, which I implemented. For the algorithm, I used its explanation to write my own comments. All final code was written, understood, and tested by me.
